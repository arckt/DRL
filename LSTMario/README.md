Attempt at playing Super Mario utilizing LTSM to learn long term patterns with random projections to encode states.

NOTE: Most (if not all) the source code comes from the official [Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action repo](https://github.com/DeepReinforcementLearning/DeepReinforcementLearningInAction). Also note that random projection code is based on this [demo](https://github.com/mostafaelaraby/gan-random-projection-pytorch)
